        <p>
          I’m a Computer Engineering graduate student at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte (GPA: 3.87/4.0), specializing in machine learning, reinforcement learning, and embedded systems. Under the supervision of Dr. Dipankar Maity, my master’s thesis titled <i>“Learning Deception and Counter-Deception Strategies in Adversarial Settings”</i> investigates multi-agent reinforcement learning frameworks for strategic behavior modeling in adversarial environments.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve conducted extensive research on multi-camera object tracking and customer behavior analysis using CLIP-based Re-ID systems and large language models at Lowe’s. At Honeywell, I developed AI-powered embedded systems for cockpit automation and predictive maintenance. My work integrates deep learning, edge deployment, and MLOps to solve real-world problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          My research spans vision-language models, adversarial learning, gesture recognition, and low-level embedded design. I enjoy building intelligent systems that combine perception, reasoning, and real-time execution.
